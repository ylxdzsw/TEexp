  (* This uses the functions defined in the above input module to run
     the multiplicative weights algorithm. The outputs are, in this

     1. The number of iterations the algorithm ran for.
     2. A list of structures (e.g. paths or trees) with associated
        weights.  The intended use is that when something needs to be
        routed, one should normalize and use the weights as a
        probability distribution, select a structure accordingly, and
        route using that structure.
     3. The original topology, but with weights modified to reflect
        the final state of the algorithm. *)
